# "Muzon" Oh-My-Posh Theme

Welcome to my Oh-My-Posh theme! This repository contains a theme configured by me for [Oh-My-Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), which you are free to use and customize.

## Usage
1. Install Oh-My-Posh and follow the instructions on their website.
2. Open the muzon.omp.json file in Github and click the button "raw". This will open a new tab with the raw content of the theme.
3. Copy the URL from the browser and paste it in the $PROFILE of Windows Terminal. More information on how to do that on Oh-My-Posh.

## Acknowledgements
